# Dynamic Zoning

<!-- badges: start -->
`r badger::badge_repostatus("Active")`
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dz is to showcase algorithms developed to handle dynamic zoning applications for the team-orienteering problem.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dz from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rosenkrands/dz")
```

We can then load the library with the following command:

```{r load_library}
library(dz)
```


## Test instances

There are 7 seven test instances included in the package.
They can be accessed with `dz::test_instances`.
```{r number_of_test_instances}
length(test_instances)
```

```{r plot_test_instance}
set.seed(123)
inst <- test_instances$p7_chao

plot(inst, delaunay = T)
```

## Clustering

With the `clustering` function we are able to decompose an instance into a number of disjoint sets (disregarding the source node).

As of now there are two methods to perform the clustering; the greedy approach and a local search approach.
Below we can see the resulting clusters from the greedy approach.

```{r perform_clustering_gr, cache = T, echo = F, results = F}
variances <- generate_variances(inst, bounds = c("min" = 10, "max" = 100))
info <- generate_information(inst, r = 20)

clust_gr <- clustering(
  inst = inst,
  k = 4,
  L = 80,
  eps = 0,
  variances = variances,
  info = info,
  cluster_method = "greedy"
)

plot(clust_gr)
```


The local search approach tries to improve on the greedy approach using an insertion operator.
Resulting clusters from the local search approach are shown below.

```{r perform_clustering_ls, echo=F, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(33)
suppressMessages(
  clust_ls <- clustering(
    inst = inst,
    k = 4,
    L = 80,
    eps = 0,
    variances = variances,
    info = info,
    cluster_method = "local_search",
    alpha = 1
  )
)

# saveRDS(clust_ls, file = "clust_ls.rds")

plot(clust_ls)
```

In the below animation we can see how the initial clustering in iteratively improved using the local search approach.

The animation is created using `animate_local_search(clust_ls)`.
