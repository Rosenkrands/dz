\title{Generation of inital routes as part of the pre-mission clustering}
\usage{
initial_route(inst, L, variances, info)
}
\arguments{
\item{inst}{Instance object returned from the `instance` function}

\item{L}{The range for each agent (homogenous agents are assumed)}

\item{variances}{A set of variances returned from the `generate_variances` function}

\item{info}{An information matrix returned by the `generate_information` function}
}
\value{
A route satisfying the range constraint, represented as an integer vector
}
\description{
This function will sample the first node between all nodes in proportion to SDR, afterwards it will select the next node greedily maximizing SDR.
It will update expected score based on whether anything unexpected comes up.
